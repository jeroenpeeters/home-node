Home-Node
=========

Home-Node is a NodeJs application that offers a configurable dashboard to control home appliances, such a lighting devices.
Secondly this NodeJs application is targeted to run on the RaspberryPi, creating a powerfull but low powered home 
automation device.

Home-Node uses Mochad for controlling devices (http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mochad/index.php?title=Main_Page).

My setup:
- RaspberryPi with Mochad-0.1.15 + Home-Node
- Marmitek CM15Pro X10 + RF controller
- 2x LMM32 Lamp/Dimmer Module
